<h2>JDBC Table Class</h2>
<p>The generated JDBC classes can persist any Java class with standard accessors, 
and &quot;id&quot; fields. 
It can also persist contained classes and references. See the
<a href="../../code/index.html">examples</a>.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this persistence framework is to produce human readable JDBC code 
that can be managed at a developer level.&nbsp; Many frameworks exist to persist 
Java classes via xml schema definitions. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://db.apache.org/torque/">
	Apache Torque </a></li>
	<li><a href="http://db.apache.org/ojb/">
	Apache OJB </a></li>
</ul>

<p>Because persistence behavior is complex, I have found it easier to control 
the behavior of contained relationships via code rather than complex xml schema 
manipulation. This project can generate 95% of your JDBC code.</p>
<h3>Table Level Persistence</h3>
<p>All persistable classes have a corresponding SQL table. Table columns relate 
directly to Java class &quot;fields&quot;.</p>
<h3>Manager Classes</h3>
<p>Each persistable class also has a &quot;manager&quot; class that manages the contained 
relationships. You can control, through code comments, which contained 
relationships get persisted, or deleted.</p>
<h3>ID Fields</h3>
<p>Each class needing persistence must include a numeric &quot;id&quot; field. This id 
field corresponds to the primary key field of the table row. In addition, each 
reference needing persistence, must also have an &quot;id&quot; field. This will be 
populated by the foreign-key. This is similar to how OJB and Torque persist 
their classes.</p>
