<h2>Blog Example</h2>
<p>
This is a basic persistence example with two classes, Blog and BlogCategory.
Each class has a corresponding "table" class, BlogTable, and BlogCategory, and
an optional corresponding "manager" class. The manager class is used to control
complex loading of classes that have references to other objects.
