XGen is a transformation engine. It provides a framework to load input data, 
and process that data into a different output formats. It has been used primarily
as a source code generator using the Velocity template engine. 
</p>
<p>Loaders and templates have been build to generate:</p>
<ul>
	<li>JDBC persistence classes</li>
	<li>POJO plain old java objects</li>
	<li>Xml2Html conversions</li>
	<li>Html documentation</li>
</ul>

that is defined at runtime. 
<h4>November 2004</h4>
<p>XGen Documentation is updated and released.</p>
<h4>April 2004</h4>
