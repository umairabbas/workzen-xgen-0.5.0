<h2>Technical Information</h2>
<p>XGen is a framework for managing transformations. Input data is loaded into 
an object model, and processed using a template engine. There are three components 
used in the transformation: loaders, processors and models.</p>
<h3>Loaders</h3>
<p>The loader is responsible for loading the object model. Source data used by 
the loader could be anything, a text file, and xml file, a database, a web 
service, etc. </p>
<h3>Processors</h3>
<p>A processor transforms the input data, and persists the data in some way.&nbsp; 
A processor is typically a template engine. XGen provides a VelocityProcessor 
and templates to transform models. For more information on Velocity visit the Apache
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/">website</a>.</p>

<h3>Models</h3>
<p>Object models are the key to the transformation. By building a model of the 
input data, it can be easily transformed. Anything can be modeled. XGen provides 
a number of models around which transformations can be performed.</p>
<p>And finally we need a way to execute the transformation. XGen provides an Ant 
task that invokes the loader, and causes the engine to process the data.</p>
